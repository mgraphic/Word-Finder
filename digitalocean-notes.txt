Hello Keith,

Thank you for contacting DigitalOcean support! Sorry to hear that you are facing an error of exit code: 137. We are happy to help you here.

The exit code 137 typically indicates that the process was killed due to running out of memory. This is a common issue on servers with limited RAM. To resolve this issue firstly you have to check the memory usage using the following command:
free -m

If your droplet has limited RAM, you can create a swap file to provide additional virtual memory by following the below commands:
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

Additionally, if you want to make the swap file permanent, add it to your /etc/fstab file as per the below:
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

Also, please find the below link which will also give you more context about how to add Swap space:

Furthermore, we also recommend you that kindly optimize the Dockerfile which helps to reduce memory usage during the build process.
